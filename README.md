# MicroService App
## What is the definition of a web service?
A web service is a software system that supports interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. It has an interface described in a machine-processable format (specifically, web Service Definition Language, or WSDL). web services fulfill a specific task or a set of tasks.

## Web Services Used in This App
- Soap
- GRPC
- Rest
- GraphQL

### Soap
SOAP is a messaging protocol for exchanging information between two computers based on XML over the internet. SOAP messages are purely written in XML which is why they are platform and language independent.

#### WSDL
 WSDL is used to define the service interface. It outlines the operations the web service provides, the data types it uses, the interaction protocol, and the location of the web service.

### Rest
REST is a set of guidelines that software can use to communicate over the internet in order to make integrations simple and scalable either in Json or XML.

### GRPC
GRPC  revolves around the idea of defining a service, such as identifying the methods that can be remotely called with their parameters and return types. However, gRPC provides sophisticated technologies that are efficient and scalable, such as HTTP/2 and streams.It can use protocol buffers as both its Interface Definition Language (IDL) and as its underlying message interchange format.

### GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
